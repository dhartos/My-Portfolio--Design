                <h2>Jurbber- Job searching app</h2>
                <p>Introducing Jurbber, a personal well-designed job search mobile app. Below are notable features in the app design</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Job Categories Section: <br> The homepage features a job categories section with a quick search bar for users who prefer to type in their specific queries. This helps users quickly find relevant opportunities by providing intuitive and easily understandable categories.</li>
                <li>Job Listing Page <br>
                    The job listing page is where users find potential opportunities that match their search criteria. I maintained a consistent layout for job listings with clear titles, company names, and payment. This page is tailored according to the input on the search screen, including filters for job type, salary range, and company to help users narrow down their search effectively.</li>
                    <li>User Profile Screen <br>
                        The user profile screen showcases the user's skills, education, and experience. I designed the screen to allow users to easily edit and update their profiles, including sections for skills, education, and work experience. This makes it simple for users to keep their profiles current and relevant to potential employers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By focusing on clear categorization, user-friendly layouts, advanced filtering options, and interactive elements, I created a job search platform that not only meets but exceeds user expectations.</p>
